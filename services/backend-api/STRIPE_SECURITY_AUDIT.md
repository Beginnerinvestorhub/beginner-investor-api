sensitive.forEach(key => {
  if (!process.env[key] || process.env[key].includes('test')) {
    console.log('✅', key, 'properly configured');
  } else {
    console.log('❌', key, 'may be exposed');
  }
});
"
```

### **Webhook Security Check**
```bash
# Test webhook signature verification
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/paywall/webhooks/payment \
  -H "stripe-signature: invalid_signature" \
  -d '{"type": "test"}'

# Should return 400 Bad Request
```

### **Authentication Security Check**
```bash
# Test authentication bypass attempts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/paywall/subscribe/checkout \
  -d '{"tier": "BASIC"}'

# Should return 401 Unauthorized
