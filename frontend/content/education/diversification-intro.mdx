<GlossaryTooltip term="Diversification" definition="A risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio." /> is one of the most important concepts in investing.

### Why Diversify?

By spreading your investments across different:
- **Asset classes** (stocks, bonds, real estate)
- **Industries** (tech, healthcare, finance)
- **Geographic regions** (domestic, international)

You reduce the risk that one bad investment will sink your entire portfolio.

### The Math Behind It

If you own 10 stocks and one crashes by 50%, you only lose 5% of your portfolio value. But if you own just that one stock, you lose 50%!

### Key Takeaways

1. **Spread risk** across multiple investments
2. **Different sectors** perform differently over time
3. **Rebalance regularly** to maintain your target allocation
